    <div>Werner Karl Heisenberg (pronounced [ˈvɛʁnɐ kaʁl ˈhaɪzn̩bɛʁk] ⓘ; 5 December 1901 – 1 February 1976)[2] was a 
        German theoretical physicist and one of the main pioneers of the theory of quantum mechanics. He published his 
        work in 1925 in a major breakthrough paper. In the subsequent series of papers with Max Born and Pascual Jordan, 
        during the same year, his matrix formulation of quantum mechanics was substantially elaborated. He is known for the 
        uncertainty principle, which he published in 1927. Heisenberg was awarded the 1932 Nobel Prize in Physics "for the 
        creation of quantum mechanics".[3][a]</div>
    <div>Heisenberg also made contributions to the theories of the hydrodynamics of turbulent flows, the atomic nucleus, 
        ferromagnetism, cosmic rays, and subatomic particles. He was a principal scientist in the Nazi nuclear weapons program 
        during World War II. He was also instrumental in planning the first West German nuclear reactor at Karlsruhe, together
         with a research reactor in Munich, in 1957.</div>
